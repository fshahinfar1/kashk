# What is This?

I found a bug when using the bpf\_loop. This folder holds my attempt to reduce
the size of the code reproducing the bug.
Look at (this)[https://lore.kernel.org/bpf/901d67ce-1344-4015-ac2d-7ca7dc28acc4@polimi.it/]
mail for further information.

Take away, for now use the newer version of the kernel from `bpf-next` branch.
